# PyBer-Analysis
Analyze all the Pyber rideshare data and create a compelling visualization with Matplotlib
## Overview
As a newly hired data analyst for Pyber, a Rideshare company, I am going to perform exploratory analysis on data that is stored in many .csv files. Pyber Rideshare company has been doing research on their ride-sharing data from the first quarter of 2019. Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib were all used to create visualization to better share the findings on the relationship between the type of city (urban, suburban, or rural) and the number of drivers and riders. In addition, I examined the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by city type. Finally, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph portraying the total weekly fares for each city type were generated.
## Results

## Summary
- PyBer would likely benefit from increasing their marketing budget so they have more customers. The market is so oversauturated that many of the drivers are not receiving work, thus gaining more riders should be a priority.
- Putting a freeze on the hiring of new employees in Urban cities until the customer base is more proportionate to the number of available drivers could increase profits as well. Each driver needs to have a minimum of 1 ride during each quarter.
- It would be helpful to collect additionaly data on Rural cities. It could provide insight on why the fares are consistently so low or why there seems to be little to no demand for ride-share services.
